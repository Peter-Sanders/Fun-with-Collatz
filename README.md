# Fun-with-Collatz
Working with the Collatz Conjecture  



This script iterates through a range of numbers and gets their Collatz Sequence length. Every several iterations, statistics
are recorded with the option of appending them to a csv file.


Plotting with Matplotlib is also included as well as the option of saving the plot to a file.

If you don't want to show the plot or save the plot, comment out the p.savefig() and plt.show() commands, respectively



####NOTE#####
This can take quite a while to run when using large numbers so be careful
